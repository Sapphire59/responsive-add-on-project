            <h3>Kerala, God's Own Country</h3>
            <p>
              Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly
              600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its palm-lined
              beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. Inland are the
              Western Ghats, mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and
              spice plantations as well as wildlife. National parks like
              Eravikulam and Periyar, plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are
              home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kerala is a region of great natural beauty.The climate of Kerala
              is equable and varies little from season to season. Throughout the
              year, daily temperatures usually rise from the low 70s F into the
              80s F.The watery coastal zones of Kerala are interspersed with
              coconut palm groves,while much of the Western Ghats and riverine
              areas are covered with rainforests and monsoon forests.
